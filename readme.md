#### Description
- Getting started with JavaScript/Node modules and nmp. Displays and shows command line interface relationship. (Note: We can use the Node Package Manager or npm to install tools from the command line to use in our project. When we installed Node.js, npm was also installed automatically. For this project, we're going to download a package which lets us ask for user input from the command line.)
